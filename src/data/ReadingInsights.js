      "Sometimes growth does not come from movement, but from waiting. What does it mean to truly tarry before God?",
    content: `
      <p>Waiting on God is not inactivity; it is alignment.</p>

      <p>Isaac remained in Gerar during famine, not because the land was safe, but because the Lord instructed him to stay. In that season of obedience, he reaped a hundredfold harvest.</p>

      <p>Tarrying requires trust. It demands that we resist the pressure to move prematurely and instead cultivate patience in the presence of God.</p>

      <p>When we tarry, our roots go deeper. And when the season shifts, fruit comes naturally.</p>

      <p>Every book we read leaves a fingerprint on our thinking.</p>

      <p>When reading is intentional, it becomes transformative. The right words at the right time can unlock buried passions and awaken dormant callings.</p>

      <p>Purpose is rarely discovered in noise. It is found in reflection, prayer, and wisdom carefully absorbed.</p>

      <p>Choose books that stretch your faith, sharpen your vision, and align you with God's direction.</p>

      <p>Faith-filled leadership begins long before visibility.</p>

      <p>Books serve as mentors. Through them, we borrow wisdom from those who have walked the path before us.</p>

      <p>True leadership is not about control, but stewardship of influence for God's glory.</p>

      <p>A life rooted in prayer remains resilient in uncertainty and steady in pressure.</p>

      <p>Books on prayer guide us, but practice anchors us.</p>
